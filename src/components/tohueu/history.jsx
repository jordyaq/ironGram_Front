    <h3>
    In November 2013, after discovering their shared interest in starting a business based around traditional Mexican handicrafts,
     Stephen and Alfredo planned their first trip to Guerrero visiting various communities in Guerrero (Chilapa, Tixtla, Chilpancingo etc)
      where they met many different artisans. The idea was to buy their handicrafts and wooden masks at a fair price from the artisans and
       then sell them in Mexico City. In this way the artisan saves on transport costs and is sure that the buyers in Mexico City are not able
        to take advantage and buy their handicrafts at too low a cost. 
    </h3>


    <h3>
    In this way the project started, with 3000 pesos in their pocket, Alfredo and Stephen collaborated with different artisans and bought their first masks. 

    </h3>


    <h3>
    Upon returning to Mexico City, Alfredo and Stephen very quickly realized that the market for artisan goods was very difficult.
     The goods were very easily damaged in transit and people were not prepared to pay a fair price despite all the work that the art demands.

    <h3>
    This is when the idea to develop a brand of mezcal from Guerrero arose. On their next trips to Guerrero, 
    Alfredo and Stephen dedicated their time to visiting and discovering artisanal and ancestral mezcal factories that were unknown in the state.
     They tasted more than 10 mezcal from different producers until they found the mezcal that they liked the most. The chosen mezcal came from a small 
     nahuatl-speaking community in the town of Eduardo Neri in the centre of Guerrero. Don Lino the master mezcalero did not have his own factory. 
     He was only able to use the community factory in the town and produce his mezcal once a year. When we first met him, his son Juan who was 18 years old 
     at the time said that he was considering crossing the border to find agricultural work in the United States. Juan also refused to speak nahuatl,
      he felt ashamed by his language and preferred to speak Spanish . We offered to work together with them to not only develop a mezcal brand,
       but also in the future to sponsor the construction of a mezcal factory for Don Lino and ensure that Juan has a stable job.
        With the profits they made from the sale of their masks, Alfredo and Stephen bought 50 liters of mezcal from Don Lino and his wife Santa who is
         in charge of sales and administration of the factory and house.

    <h3>

        In May 2015, the company Comercializadora Rysacourt S.A de C.V was officially founded 
    </h3>

    <h3>

        With sale upon sale and bottle after bottle being sold, in March 2016 the 3000 initially invested allowed us to finance 75% of a personal 
        factory for Don Lino and his family (with an alembic, 4 ayacahuite (pine) fermentation tubs certified by the board of mezcal, and a packing machine).
         The other 25% was paid for by Don Lino and Santa’s older son, Enrique, who is also associated with the project.

    </h3>

    <h3>
    In September 2018 the first batch of mezcal certified by the regulatory board of mezcal was produced, ready to be exported to Europe (Spain and Switzerland).
