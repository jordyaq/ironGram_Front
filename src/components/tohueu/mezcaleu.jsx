            <p>
            Our master mezcaleros scour the mountains of Guerrero to collect the agave plants that have reached peak maturity of between
             12 to 20 years. In this way it is guaranteed that no artificial chemical is used in the growth of this plant, it is 100% natural.

                <p> We cook our agave with ancestral methods in artisan ovens, following the traditions of the ancestors of Tohue Tohue’s
                 master mezcaleros. The ovens are built with stone bases and walls, in which they use wood as a fuel. Once the oven is built
                  it is filled with the agave hearts ready to be cooked and afterwards they are covered with a layer of palm leaves and then a
                   layer of earth. This cooking process takes approximately 4 to 6 days. Once they are cooked, the agave hearts are taken to the mill,
                    where they are mashed by hand with a hatchet and then they are ground by a mechanical mill to ensure successful fermentation.

                     a cooling coil and a connector. The distillation begins when the husk empties, and the juice of the agave in the cooking pot begins 
                     to boil and produce a vapor, which passes through the connector tube and reaches the cooling coil and is converted into a liquid,
                      this is the first product of the process called ‘simple’. The product is then distilled a second time , creating a more refined mezcal.
